This example demonstrates how to build a bare-metal application using
different ARM toolchains. It is designed for the Nordic pca100001/pca100024
evaluation kit (based on nRF51822 MCU) and simply flashes the green
LED on the board.

The following toolchains are supported:

  * GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
  * IAR Embedded Workbench
  * KEIL Microcontroller Development Kit
