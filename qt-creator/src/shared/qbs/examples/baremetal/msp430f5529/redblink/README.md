This example demonstrates how to build a bare-metal application using
different MSP430 toolchains. It is designed for the MSP-EXP430F5529LP
target board (based on msp430f5529 chip) and simply flashes the red
LED on the board.

The following toolchains are supported:

  * IAR Embedded Workbench
  * GCC
