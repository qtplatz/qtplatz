This example demonstrates how to build a bare-metal application using
different ARM toolchains. It is designed for the stm32f103 "Blue Pill"
evaluation kit (based on stm32f103c8 MCU) and simply flashes the green
LED on the board.

The following toolchains are supported:

  * GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
  * IAR Embedded Workbench
  * KEIL Microcontroller Development Kit
