This example demonstrates how to build a bare-metal application using
different MCS-51 toolchains. It is designed for the CC2540 usb dongle
target board (based on Texas Instruments CC2540 wireless MCU) and
simply flashes the green LED on the board.

The following toolchains are supported:

  * IAR Embedded Workbench
  * KEIL uVision
