This example demonstrates how to build a bare-metal application using
different ARM toolchains. It is designed for the Nordic pca10040
evaluation kit (based on nRF52832 MCU) and simply flashes the green
LED on the board.

The following toolchains are supported:

  * GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
  * IAR Embedded Workbench
  * KEIL Microcontroller Development Kit
