    \qmltype qbspkgconfig
    \inqmlmodule QbsModuleProviders
    \since 1.20

    \brief Module provider based on the qbspkg-config library.

    \QBS uses a built-in parser of the \c{*.pc} files and does not require the presence of the
    \c pkg-config tool in the system. However, if the \c pkg-config tool is present, \QBS will
    use the same libDirs as the system pkg-config uses by default; otherwise, a built-in list of
    paths is used.

    In order to enable usage of this provider in your Product, set the
    \l{Product::qbsModuleProviders}{qbsModuleProviders} property as shown in the example below:
    \snippet ../examples/pkgconfig-provider/pkgconfig-provider.qbs 0
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string qbspkgconfig::executableFilePath

    The path to the \c {pkg-config} executable. If not set, the pkg-config from PATH is used.

    \defaultvalue undefined
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty stringList qbspkgconfig::libDirs

    Set this if you need to overwrite the default search directories.
    \note You do not need to set this for cross-compilation in order to point
          to the sysroot. \QBS does that for you.

    This property is the equivalent of the \c{PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR} variable
    for the \c{pkg-config} tool.

    \nodefaultvalue
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty stringList qbspkgconfig::extraPaths

    Set this if you need to add extra search directories.

    This property is the equivalent of the \c{PKG_CONFIG_PATH} variable
    for the \c{pkg-config} tool.

    \nodefaultvalue
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool qbspkgconfig::staticMode

    If this property is \c true, then \QBS will include "private" libs and dependencies of the
    package. This property is the equivalent of the
    \c{--static} option for the \c{pkg-config} tool.

    Set this if your product is to be linked statically.

    \defaultvalue \c false
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool qbspkgconfig::definePrefix

    If this property is \c true, then \QBS will override the ${prefix} variable in the packages
    with a value that is guessed based on the location of the .pc file.

    This option corresponds to the \c --define-prefix / \c --dont-define-prefix command line
    options of the \c pkg-config tool.

    \defaultvalue \c true on Windows, \c false otherwise
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty path qbspkgconfig::sysroot

    Set this property if you need to overwrite the default search sysroot path used by
    \c pkg-config.

    This can be useful if \c pkg-config files are located in the directory other than qbs.sysroot.
    This is the case on macOS platform - all XCode profiles are sysrooted to the SDK
    directory, but \c pkg-config is typically intalled using Brew and resides in the
    \c /usr/local directory.

    Setting this property to \c undefined or empty (\c "") value will use pkg-config's default
    search paths:
    \code
        qbs resolve moduleProviders.qbspkgconfig.sysroot:undefined
    \endcode

    This property is the equivalent of the \c{PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR} variable for the
    \c{pkg-config} tool.

    \defaultvalue \c "" on macOS, \c qbs.sysroot on other platforms
