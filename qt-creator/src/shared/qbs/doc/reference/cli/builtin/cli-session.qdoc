    \brief Starts a session for interacting with an IDE

    \section1 Description

    Starts a session, communicating via standard input and standard output.

    In this mode, \QBS takes commands from standard input and sends replies
    to standard output, using a \l{Appendix C: The JSON API}{JSON-based API}.

    This is the recommended \QBS interface for IDEs. It can be used to retrieve
    information about a project and interact with it in various ways, such
    as building it, collecting the list of executables, adding new source files
    and so on.
