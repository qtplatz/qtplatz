    \title update-timestamps
    \brief Marks the build as up-to-date.

    \section1 Synopsis

    \code
    qbs update-timestamps [options] [config:configuration-name] ...
    \endcode

    \section1 Description

    Updates the timestamps of all build \l{Artifact}{artifacts}, causing
    the next builds of the \l{Project}{project} to do nothing until source
    files are updated again.

    This command is useful if you know that the current changes to source files
    are irrelevant to the build.

    \note Using this command causes a discrepancy between the actual state of
    source files and the information in the build graph, so be careful.
