    \title setup-toolchains
    \brief Creates \QBS profiles for toolchains, such as GCC or MSVC.

    \section1 Synopsis

    \code
    qbs setup-toolchains [--settings-dir <directory>] [--system] --detect
    qbs setup-toolchains [--settings-dir <directory>] [--system] [--type <toolchain type>]
                         <compiler path> <profile name>
    \endcode

    \section1 Description

    The first form tries to auto-detect all known toolchains, looking them up
    via the PATH variable.

    The second form creates a profile with the name \c {<profile name>} for the
    toolchain located at \c {<compiler path>}. It will attempt to
    determine the toolchain type automatically based on the file name or the
    compiler executable. If that fails, you need to provide the compiler type as
    a value of the \c --type option.

    For more information, see \l{Configuring Profiles and Preferences}.

    \section1 Options

    \include cli-options.qdocinc settings-dir
    \include cli-options.qdocinc setup-tools-system
    \include cli-options.qdocinc detect-toolchains
    \include cli-options.qdocinc type
    \include cli-options.qdocinc help

    \section1 Examples

    Looks up toolchains via the PATH variable and creates profiles for them:

    \code
    qbs setup-toolchains --detect
    \endcode

    Creates a profile called \c mingw for the toolchain located in
    \c C:\mingw530_32\bin on Windows:

    \code
    qbs setup-toolchains C:\mingw530_32\bin\g++.exe mingw
    \endcode

    Creates a profile called \c g++-mingw-w64 for the toolchain located in
    \c /usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ g++-mingw-w64 on Ubuntu:

    \code
    qbs setup-toolchains /usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ g++-mingw-w64
    \endcode
