    \title create-project
    \brief Creates a \QBS project from an existing set of source files.

    \section1 Synopsis

    \code
    qbs create-project [--blacklist <blacklist>] [--whitelist <whitelist>]
                       [--flat]
    \endcode

    \section1 Description

    Automatically generates \QBS project files from an arbitrary directory
    structure. You can filter the files to add to the project by blacklisting
    or whitelisting them. The command creates nested project files, unless you
    use the \c --flat option.

    This is a useful starting point when migrating from other build tools, such
    as qmake or CMake.

    \note Run this command from the project directory.

    After generating the initial .qbs files, add the missing configuration
    variables and functions to them.

    \section1 Options

    \include cli-options.qdocinc blacklist
    \include cli-options.qdocinc whitelist
    \include cli-options.qdocinc flat
    \include cli-options.qdocinc help

    \section1 Examples

    Creates \c .qbs files in the project directory when run from there:

    \code
    qbs create-project
    \endcode
