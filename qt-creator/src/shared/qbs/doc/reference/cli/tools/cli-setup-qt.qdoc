    \section1 Description

    Creates \QBS profiles for Qt installations.

    The first form tries to auto-detect all known Qt versions, looking them up
    via the PATH variable.

    The second form creates a profile with the name \c {<profile name>} for the
    Qt version located at \c {<path to qmake>}.

    For more information, see \l{Managing Qt Versions}.

    \section1 Options

    \include cli-options.qdocinc detect-qt-versions
    \include cli-options.qdocinc settings-dir
    \include cli-options.qdocinc setup-tools-system
    \include cli-options.qdocinc help

    \section1 Examples

    Looks up Qt versions in the PATH and creates profiles for them:

    \code
    qbs setup-qt --detect
    \endcode

    Creates a profile called \c myqt for the Qt version located in
    \c /usr/bin/qmake:

    \code
    qbs setup-qt /usr/bin/qmake myqt
    \endcode
