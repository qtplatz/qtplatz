    \qmltype pkgconfig
    \inqmlmodule QbsModules
    \since 1.13

    \brief Allows to configure the pkg-config tool.

    The \c pkgconfig module is used to fine-tune the behavior of the \c {pkg-config} tool,
    which is
    \l{How do I build against libraries that provide pkg-config files?}{potentially employed}
    when looking up dependencies.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string pkgconfig::executableFilePath

    The path to the \c {pkg-config} executable.

    \defaultvalue auto-detected
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty stringList pkgconfig::libDirs

    Set this if you need to overwrite the default search directories. The values
    given here will be forwarded to the tool via the \c PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR environment
    variable.
    \note You do not need to set this for cross-compilation in order to point
          \c {pkg-config} to the sysroot. \QBS does that for you.

    \nodefaultvalue
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool pkgconfig::staticMode

    If this property is \c true, then calls to \c{pkg-config} will include the
    \c{--static} option. Set this if your product is to be linked statically.

    \defaultvalue \c false
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty path pkgconfig::sysroot

    This property controls the value of the \l{PkgConfigProbe::sysroot}{PkgConfigProbe.sysroot}
    property.

    Set this property if you need to overwrite the default search sysroot path used by
    \c pkg-config.

    This can be useful if \c pkg-config files are located in the directory other than qbs.sysroot.
    This is the case on macOS platform - all XCode profiles are sysrooted to the SDK
    directory, but \c pkg-config is typically intalled using Brew and resides in the
    \c /usr/local directory.

    Setting this property to \c undefined or empty (\c "") value will use pkg-config's default
    search paths:
    \code
        qbs build modules.pkgconfig.sysroot:undefined
    \endcode

    \defaultvalue \c "" on macOS, \c qbs.sysroot on other platforms
