    \brief Provides support for building ICO (.ico) and CUR (.cur) files.

    The \c ico module contains properties and rules for building
    Microsoft Windows Icon (.ico) and Microsoft Windows Cursor (.cur) files.

    \note This module relies on the \c icotool command-line tool from the
    \c icotools package, which must be installed separately and found in the
    \c PATH or an appropriate system binaries directory for your system (for
    example, \c /usr/bin or \c /usr/local/bin).

/*!
    \qmlproperty int ico::cursorHotspotX

    The cursor hotspot x coordinate. Only relevant when building .cur files.

    This property must be set individually for each input PNG file.

    \note \c icoutils version 0.32 or greater is required to set the
    hotspot in cursor files with multiple images.

    \nodefaultvalue
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int ico::cursorHotspotY

    The cursor hotspot y coordinate. Only relevant when building .cur files.

    This property must be set individually for each input PNG file.

    \note \c icoutils version 0.32 or greater is required to set the
    hotspot in cursor files with multiple images.

    \nodefaultvalue
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool ico::raw

    Whether to store the input file as a raw PNG, as supported in Windows Vista.

    Only relevant when building .ico files.

    This property must be set individually for each input PNG file.

    It is recommended to set this value only for icon sizes larger than or equal
    to 256x256.

    \defaultvalue \c{false}
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string ico::icotoolFilePath

    The full path of the \c icotool binary.

    This property should not normally need to be changed if \QBS was able to
    automatically detect it.

    \defaultvalue Determined automatically.
