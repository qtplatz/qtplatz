    \brief Provides support for the \c lex and \c yacc tools.

    The \c lex_yacc module allows you to create scanners and parsers via the POSIX tools \c lex
    and \c yacc, respectively. These tools are closely related and share a number of properties,
    which is why they are represented by a single module.

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool lex_yacc::enableCompilerWarnings
    \since Qbs 1.8

    Whether compiler warnings are displayed.

    Because \c lex and \c yacc are known to produce files that will trigger
    compiler warnings, such warnings are suppressed by default. Set this
    property to \c true if you want to see them.

    \defaultvalue \c{false}
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string lex_yacc::lexBinary

    The file path of the \c lex tool.

    \defaultvalue \c{"lex"}
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty stringList lex_yacc::lexFlags

    Additional command-line options for the \c lex tool.

    \defaultvalue \c []
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string lex_yacc::lexOutputFilePath

    The output file for the \c lex tool.

    This corresponds to \c{%option outfile} in the .l file.
    If \c{%option outfile} is set in the .l file then this property is ignored.

    \defaultvalue \c undefined
    \since 1.12
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string lex_yacc::outputTag

    The file tag for the generated scanner and parser sources.

    Use \l{filetags-cpp}{"cpp"} if you want to use a C++ compiler on them.

    \defaultvalue \l{filetags-cpp}{"c"}
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool lex_yacc::uniqueSymbolPrefix

    If this property is \c true, the prefix \c yy normally used for the
    generated lexer and parser functions is replaced by the base name of the
    file provided as input to \c lex and \c yacc, respectively.

    Enable this property if you want to use more than one lexer or parser in a
    single product.

    \note Enabling this property requires that the associated lexer and scanner
    source files have the same base name. It also assumes a variant of \c lex
    that supports the non-POSIX option \c{-P}, such as \c flex.

    \defaultvalue \c{false}
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string lex_yacc::yaccBinary

    The file path of the \c yacc tool.

    \defaultvalue \c{"yacc"}
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty stringList lex_yacc::yaccFlags

    Additional command-line options for the \c yacc tool.

    \defaultvalue \c []
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string lex_yacc::yaccOutputFilePath

    Main output file for the \c yacc tool.

    This corresponds to \c{%output} in the .y file.
    If \c{%output} is set in the .y file then this property is ignored.

    \defaultvalue \c undefined
