    \brief Provides conditional setting of properties.

    \note This topic documents the Properties item in the context of \l{Product}
    {products}. For more information about using it in sub-projects, see
    \l{SubProject}.

    The Properties item is an auxiliary item for setting multiple property values conditionally.

    In the following example, two properties are set if the project is built for Windows:
    \code
    Product {
        Properties {
            condition: qbs.targetOS.includes("windows")
            cpp.defines: ["ON_WINDOWS"]
            cpp.includePaths: ["extraWindowsIncludes"]
        }
    }
    \endcode

    Multiple Properties items can be specified to set properties dependent on different
    conditions. The order of appearance is important. Semantics are similar to if-else-chains.
    The following example
    \code
    Product {
        Properties {
            condition: qbs.targetOS.includes("windows")
            cpp.defines: ["ON_WINDOWS"]
            cpp.includePaths: ["myWindowsIncludes"]
        }
        Properties {
            condition: qbs.targetOS.includes("linux")
            cpp.defines: ["ON_LINUX"]
            cpp.includePaths: ["myLinuxIncludes"]
        }
        cpp.defines: ["ON_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM"]
    }
    \endcode
    is equivalent to
    \code
    Product {
        cpp.defines: {
            if (qbs.targetOS.includes("windows"))
                return ["ON_WINDOWS"];
            if (qbs.targetOS.includes("linux"))
                return ["ON_LINUX"];
            return ["ON_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM"];
        }
        cpp.includePaths: {
            if (qbs.targetOS.includes("windows"))
                return ["myWindowsIncludes"];
            if (qbs.targetOS.includes("linux"))
                return ["myLinuxIncludes"];
            return base;
        }
    }
    \endcode

    In Properties items, one can access the \l{Special Property Values#outer}{outer} value of a
    property.
    \code
    Product {
        Properties {
            condition: qbs.targetOS.includes("windows")
            cpp.defines: outer.concat("ON_WINDOWS")     // === ["FOO", "ON_WINDOWS"]
        }
        Properties {
            condition: qbs.targetOS.includes("linux")
            cpp.defines: ["ON_LINUX"]                   // === ["ON_LINUX"]
        }
        cpp.defines: ["FOO"]
    }
    \endcode

    We suggest to use the Properties item for mutually exclusive conditions only. It is
    especially useful if there are several properties to set, based on the same condition.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool Properties::condition

    The condition to be used for the other bindings in this item.

    This is a mandatory property that has no default value.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool Properties::overrideListProperties

    List properties set within this item will override the values coming from
    modules, rather than getting merged with them, which is the default behavior.
    Use this in the rare case that a module you depend on inserts a value into
    a list property that is problematic for some product.

    \defaultvalue \c false
