    \brief Creates a profile within the project.

    The profiles used by \QBS are normally set up on a user's machine and are then available
    to all projects. See \l{Configuring Profiles and Preferences} for information on how
    to set up and use profiles on the command line.
    In some rare cases, however, the creator of a project has complete knowledge about the system
    on which that project is to be built. Then it can make sense to integrate the profile into
    the project:

    \code
    Product {
        // ...
        Profile {
            name: "my-special-profile"
            qbs.toolchainType: "gcc"
            qbs.targetPlatform: "linux"
            qbs.architecture: "armv7a"
            cpp.toolchainInstallPath: "/opt/special-gcc/bin"
            cpp.toolchainPrefix: "arm-linux-gnueabi-"
        }
        qbs.profiles: ["my-special-profile"]
        // ...
    }
    \endcode

    The project in the above example can be built in a particular well-known environment
    without any additional setup.

    \c Profile items can appear inside \l{Product} and \l{Project} items.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string Profile::baseProfile

    The name of a profile from which this profile inherits. If the same property is
    set in both this profile and the base profile, the value from this profile
    takes precedence.

    \nodefaultvalue
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool Profile::condition

    Determines whether this profile can be used.

    If this property is set to \c false, the profile cannot be used.

    \defaultvalue \c true
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string Profile::name

    The name under which the profile can be referenced later. Setting this property
    is required. The value must be unique among all profiles in an entire project.

    \nodefaultvalue
*/
