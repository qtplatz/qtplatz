    \brief Archive of an installed project.

    An InstallPackage item is a \l{Product}{product} of the \l{Product::}{type}
    \c{archiver.archive} that has a \l{Depends}{dependency} on the \l{archiver}
    module. It is used to produce an archive from a set of installable files.

    Consider the following example project:

    \code
    Project {
        CppApplication {
            name: "myapp"
            Depends { name: "mylib" }
            files: ["main.cpp"]
            Group {
                fileTagsFilter: product.type
                qbs.install: true
                qbs.installDir: "bin"
            }
        }
        DynamicLibrary {
            name: "mylib"
            files: ["mylib.cpp"]
            Group {
                name: "public headers"
                files: ["mylib.h"]
                qbs.install: true
                qbs.installDir: "include"
            }
            Group {
                fileTagsFilter: product.type
                qbs.install: true
                qbs.installDir: "lib"
            }
        }

        InstallPackage {
            archiver.type: "tar"
            name: "tar-package"
            Depends { name: "myapp" }
            Depends { name: "mylib" }
        }
    }
    \endcode

    Building the product \c "tar-package" on a Unix system will result in a tar
    file with these contents:

    \code
    include/mylib.h
    lib/libmylib.so
    bin/myapp
    \endcode
