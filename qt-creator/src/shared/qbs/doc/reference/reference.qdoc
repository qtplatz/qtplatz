    \title List of Built-in Services
    \QBS provides the following built-in JavaScript extensions to simplify operations that
    are expected to be needed often in project files.

    To gain access to the operations provided by a particular Service - for example,
    the File service - use the following statement at the top of your \QBS project file:
    \code
    import qbs.File
    \endcode

    If you instead need to access the service from a JavaScript file, import it using the following
    statement at the top of your JavaScript file:
    \code
    var File = require("qbs.File");
    \endcode
