    \title Building for Windows
    \brief Platform notes for Windows.

    This topic describes the \QBS features specific to Windows.

    \note \QBS does not currently support building applications using .NET
    technologies and languages such as C#, F#, and Visual Basic. At this time we
    recommend that you use MSBuild and the tools shipped with the various
    implementations of the .NET platform.

    \section1 Windows Resources

    The \l{ico} module contains rules and properties for building
    Windows icon (.ico) and cursor (.cur) files from a set of raw PNGs.

    \section1 Universal Windows Platform

    Building applications for the Universal Windows Platform is currently only
    partially supported. Notably, support for building APPX packages is missing,
    but will be added in a future release.

    Relevant properties include:

    \list
        \li \l{cpp::windowsApiFamily}{cpp.windowsApiFamily}
        \li \l{cpp::windowsApiAdditionalPartitions}
            {cpp.windowsApiAdditionalPartitions}
        \li \l{cpp::requireAppContainer}{cpp.requireAppContainer}
    \endlist

    See the \l{cpp} module for more information.

    \note \QBS does not (and will not) support building Windows Runtime
    applications targeting Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. We encourage users to
    instead build desktop applications for older versions of Windows, or migrate
    to Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform.

    \section1 Building Windows Installers

    The following modules contain properties and rules for building Windows
    installers using a number of different technologies:

    \list
        \li \l{innosetup} - Inno Setup
        \li \l{nsis} - Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
        \li \l{wix} - Windows Installer XML Toolset
    \endlist
