    \title Building for macOS
    \brief Platform notes for macOS.

    This topic describes the \QBS features specific to macOS.

    \section1 Building macOS Disk Images

    The \l{AppleDiskImage} and \l{AppleApplicationDiskImage} items have a
    dependency on the \l{dmg} module. The former represents a
    product that is a basic Apple disk image, while the latter extends the
    former to create a drag 'n' drop disk image installer used for installing
    single application bundles.

    For example, the following code snippet creates a macOS disk image with a
    custom background and icon layout:

    \code
    AppleApplicationDiskImage {
        targetName: "cocoa-application-" + version
        version: "1.0"

        files: [
            "CocoaApplication/dmg.iconset",
            "CocoaApplication/en_US.lproj/LICENSE",
            // comment out the following line to use a solid-color background
            // (see dmg.backgroundColor below)
            "CocoaApplication/background*"
        ]

        dmg.backgroundColor: "#41cd52"
        dmg.badgeVolumeIcon: true
        dmg.iconPositions: [
            {"x": 200, "y": 200, "path": "Cocoa Application.app"},
            {"x": 400, "y": 200, "path": "Applications"}
        ]
        dmg.windowX: 420
        dmg.windowY: 250
        dmg.windowWidth: 600
        dmg.windowHeight: 422 // this includes the macOS title bar height of 22
        dmg.iconSize: 64
    }
    \endcode

    In addition, \QBS supports multi-language license agreement prompts that
    appear when the DMG is opened, with full Unicode and rich-text formatting
    support.
