The QtCreator 1.1 release contains bug fixes and new features.

A more detailed list of changes follows below. If you want to know the exact
and complete list of changes, you can check out the QtCreator sources from the
public git repository and check the logs, e.g.

git clone git://labs.trolltech.com/qt-creator
git log --pretty=oneline v1.0.0..v1.1.0
